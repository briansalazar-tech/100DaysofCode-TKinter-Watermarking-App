Watermarking application was created using Python and Tkinter.

When the applicaiton is launched, you first have to select a picture. If noth the sample picture is selected by default.

Afterwards you can enter the text that you want to appear on the watermarked picture.

The font size is set to 25 by default, however, this value can be increased or decreased to your liking. 25 was the size I found most suitable for working with the sample picture.

After a picture is selected, desired text is input, and font size is set you can then watermark the picture you uploaded using ong of the five patern options that are available. Options available are top right, bottom right, centered, grid, and checkered grid.

By clicking on any of the buttons, a preview will appear with the watermark pattern and the previewed image will be saved in the exports folder.
